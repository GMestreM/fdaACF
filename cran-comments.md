## Travis CI
- linux
    - oldrel pass
    - release pass
    - devel pass
- osx
    - oldrel pass
    - release pass

* devel/osx has not been tested due to an issue with the current r-devel in osx (seen on https://travis-ci.community/t/r-devel-el-capitan-signed-pkg-fails-to-download-when-testing-on-r-devel/672/2). As CRAN doesn’t publish OSX binary packages for r-devel, I have decided to not test it.
  
## win-builder
- oldrelease pass
- release pass
- devel pass
