# fdaACF 1.0.0

New functionalities added in this release:

* Add function FTS_identification. This function is a wrapper for functions obtain_FACF and obtain_FPACF, and shows both the FACF and the FPACF of a given functional time series.
* Add citation information for the paper "Functional time series model identification and diagnosis by means of auto- and partial autocorrelation analysis" [<doi:10.1016/j.csda.2020.107108>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2020.107108). This paper contains the theoretical foundations of the autocorrelation functions implemented in this package.
* Fix minor bugs present in version 0.2.0.

# fdaACF 0.2.0

New functionalities added in this release:

* Add function obtain_FPACF. This allows the user to estimate the functional partial autocorrelation function of a given functional time series.
