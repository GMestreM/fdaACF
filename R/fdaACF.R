#' fdaACF: Autocorrelation function for Functional Time Series
#'
#' The fdaACF package provides diagnostic and analysis tools
#' to quantify the serial autocorrelation across lags of a
#' given functional time series in order to improve the identification
#' and diagnosis of functional ARIMA models. The autocorrelation function
#' is based on the L2 norm of the lagged covariance operators of the series.
#' Several real-world datasets are included to illustrate the application
#' of these techniques.
