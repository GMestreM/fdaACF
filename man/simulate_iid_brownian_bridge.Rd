\title{Simulate a FTS from a brownian bridge process}
\usage{
simulate_iid_brownian_bridge(N, v = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out =
  100), sig = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of observations of the simulated data.}

\item{v}{Discretization points of the curves, by default
\code{seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 100)}.}

\item{sig}{Standard deviation of the Brownian Motion process,
by default \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Return the simulated functional time series as a matrix.
}
\description{
Generate a functional time series from a Brownian Bridge process.
If \eqn{W(t)} is a Wiener process, the Brownian Bridge is
defined as \eqn{W(t) - tW(1)}.
Each functional observation is discretized in the points
indicated in \code{v}. The series obtained is i.i.d.
and does not exhibit any kind of serial correlation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
N <- 500
v <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 50)
sig <- 2
bbridge <- simulate_iid_brownian_bridge(N, v, sig)
matplot(v,t(bbridge), type = "l", xlab = "v", ylab = "Value")
}
