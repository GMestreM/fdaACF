\title{Estimate distribution of the fACF under the iid. hypothesis using Imhof's method}
\usage{
estimate_iid_distr_Imhof(Y, v, autocovSurface, matindex, figure = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Matrix containing the discretized values
of the functional time series. The dimension of the
matrix is \eqn{(n x m)}, where \eqn{n} is the
number of curves and \eqn{m} is the number of points
observed in each curve.}

\item{v}{Discretization points of the curves, by default
\code{seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 100)}.}

\item{autocovSurface}{An \eqn{(m x m)} matrix with the discretized
values of the autocovariance operator \eqn{\hat{C}_{0}}, obtained
by calling the function \code{obtain_autocovariance}.
The value \eqn{m} indicates the number of points observed
in each curve.}

\item{matindex}{A vector containing the L2 norm of
the autocovariance function. It can be obtained by calling
function \code{obtain_suface_L2_norm}.}

\item{figure}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, plots the
estimated distribution.}

\item{nsimul}{Positive integer indicating the number of
MC simulations that will be used to estimate the distribution
of the statistic. Increasing the number of simulations will
imrpove the estimation, but it will increase the computational
time.
By default, \code{nsimul = 10000}.}
}
\value{
Return a list with:
\itemize{
    \item \code{ex}: Knots where the
    distribution has been estimated
    \item \code{ef}: Discretized values of
    the estimated distribution.
}
}
\description{
Estimate the distribution of the autocorrelation function
under the hypothesis of strong functional white noise. This
function uses Imhof's method to estimate the distribution.
